### vgg
1. how the vgg is stored?
2. what's the stored? is it the feature map, or the wights? 
3. the structure of the stored vgg? the layers, the dimension?

### the upsample
1. the wight of layer4 and layer3 are also converted to 1x1 convolution, why? 

### practice
1. convert the vgg using tf;
2. train without vgg, end to end.
3. build a video
4. analyze the images
5. implement vgg using tf
6. not using the layers api, using the core api
